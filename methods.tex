\section{The Model}
\subsection{Model structure}
We model forest dynamics using a physiologically structured population model (PSPM), which we have made spatially explicit, based on \citet{Strigul2008}. A physiologically structured model distinguishes individuals who are at different stages of development. We first provide general definitions that are related to PSPMs and then describe our own. PSPMs are based upon individual states (hereafter, \textit{i}-states). The \textit{i}-states are collections of variables exhibiting the following two properties \citep[for an overview of PSPMs]{DeRoos1997}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item \textit{i}-states completely determine the individual's growth rate, death rate and birth rate  at any given time (possibly together with the present environmental state), and its influence on the environment,
	\item \textit{i}-states future values are completely determined by their present values, together with the intervening environmental history as encountered by the individual of concern.
\end{enumerate}
The environment is accounted for by the environmental state (hereafter, \textit{e}-state). Formally, an \textit{e}-state is a collection of biotic and abiotic factors that characterise the environment in which an individual lives and that affect individual performance. In this paper, we consider two kinds of \textit{e}-states: (\textit{i}) feedback loops, which both influence and are influenced by individuals of all species; and (\textit{ii}) external forcing factors, which are imposed on the population. By definition, the former requires a dynamic description. We ignore random variation amongst individuals that are in the same \textit{i}-state and which experience the same \textit{e}-state. The model subsequently represents cohorts rather than individual trees.

Cohort dynamics of species $ j $ and diameter $ s $ and that are located in $ x $ are modelled by a spatially-explicit version of the von Foerster--\textit{perfect plasticity approximation} model \citep[hereafter, von Foerster--PPA]{Strigul2008}:
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial N_j(s, x, t)}{\partial t} &= - \frac{\partial G_j \big(s, x; \s(x, t) \big) N_j(s, x, t)}{\partial s} - \mu_j\big(s, x; \s(x, t) \big) N_j(s, x, t) \label{eq::dynamics_x} \\
	N_j(0, x, t) &= \frac{1}{G_j(0, x; \s(x, t))} \int_0^{\infty} N_j(s, x, t) F_j\big(s; \s(x, t) \big) \, ds \label{eq::recruitment_x}
\end{align}
where $ N_j $ is the number of trees of species $ j $ per unit size per unit space, it as a density and only $ \int \int N \, ds dx $ can be considered as a number of individuals. $ G $ is the growth rate of individuals, $ \mu $ is the mortality rate, and $ F $ is the effective fecundity function (see Table \ref{tab::notations} for list of notations, definitions and units for each variable and parameter). Although we developed the model with a dispersal kernel, we decided to use a $ \delta $-Dirac distribution in this paper to maintain model tractability. Therefore, dispersion is localised to patch $ x $, and does not appear in Equation \eqref{eq::recruitment_x}. The three demographic rates are affected by a size threshold $ \s $, which is a feedback loop that is defined formally below. External factors (at a location $ x $) only influence $ G $ and $ \mu $. Equation \eqref{eq::dynamics_x} describes cohort demography, while equation \eqref{eq::recruitment_x} describes recruitment. Together, \eqref{eq::dynamics_x}--\eqref{eq::recruitment_x} represent the structured-population dynamics of trees. We use tree diameter at breast height (\textit{\textit{dbh}}) as a single \textit{i}-state and then employ allometric functions from \citet{Purves2007} to compute tree height and crown diameter.

Recent studies have extended the von Foerster--PPA model to include either nitrogen or water competition \citep{Dybzinski2011, Farrior2013}. While plants are likely to experience co-limitation of resources (\eg light, moisture, nitrogen) both intra-annually and across their life spans, leaf and root growth rates may be dominated by limitation of one particular resource at any given point in time. Yet, the identity of the limiting resource is dynamic and will shift throughout the growing season and across an individual plant's development within a forest stand \citep{Farrior2013}. Thus, modelling water and nutrient dynamics remains a challenge, as would be the case for parameterisation of demographic rates. We limit the feedback loop solely to competition for light, which is the major driver of forest dynamics in north-eastern North American forests, especially for saplings \citep{Pacala1996, Kobe2006, Purves2007}. To compensate for the lack of moisture competition, we base the \textit{e}-states on precipitation variables and temperature, which affects metabolic rates \citep{Brown2004} and, therefore, water demand. Nutrients are not explicitly considered as \textit{e}-states, but their effects upon radial growth and mortality are partially captured by random effects.

Competition for light is represented by a critical height that partitions the forest into the understorey and the overstorey (Fig. \ref{fig::ppa}). The vertical position of trees determines growth and mortality thereafter. The equation describing the feedback loop between cohort dynamics and light availability is:
\begin{equation}
	1 = \sum_{j = 1}^{n} \int_{\s(x)}^{\infty} N_j(s, x, t) \A_j \big(s; \s(x, t)\big) \, ds \label{eq::ppa_x}
\end{equation}
where $ \A $ denotes the cross-sectional area of the crown of an individual of size $ s $ (Fig. \ref{fig::ppa}). This last equation \eqref{eq::ppa_x} defines a size threshold $ \s $, which differentiates the behaviour of individuals that are above $ \s $ from those that are below. Hence, $ \s $ is such that the sum of the area of individual crowns equals the area of the plot being considered. Trees with a height below $ \s $ are fully shaded whereas trees above $ \s $ are in the overstorey and receive direct sunlight. When the canopy is open, a positive value of $ \s $ cannot be attained and, therefore, $ \s $ is set to $ 0 $. When the size variable is the height of trees, $ \s $ is then independent of the species. However, when the \textit{dbh} is the size variable, $ \s $ then becomes species-specific (due to species-specificity of the allometric functions relating height to \textit{dbh}). Equation \eqref{eq::ppa_x} is adapted from \citet{Strigul2008} and, therefore, obeys the \textit{perfect-plasticity approximation} assumption (PPA): the canopy is a collection of small crowns that can be reorganised such that the area occupied is maximised. Despite this optimisation of sun exposure being considered theoretical, combining PPA with von Foerster equations can accurately reproduce forest dynamics at stand scales, within a relatively homogeneous physical environment \citep{Strigul2008, Purves2008}. The set of three equations (\ref{eq::dynamics_x}--\ref{eq::ppa_x}) forms a tractable PSPM, which allows us to derive $ R_0 $ analytically.

	\caption{Traditionally, light availability is assumed to decrease progressively from the top of the canopy to the forest floor, obeying the Beer's law (left arrow). Here, we assume there is a threshold $ \s $ partitions the forest into two strata, thereby defining therefore two light levels (right arrow): $ L_u $ and $ L_o $ for understorey and overstorey light, respectively. Therefore, light is a stepwise function of canopy height. The threshold $ \s $ is the maximum height at which the canopy is closed; at this particular height, the sum of all the cross-sections equals the plot area. $ \A(s, \sigma) $ is crown cross-sectional area at height $ \sigma $ for an individual of height $ s $. \label{fig::ppa}}

\subsection{Net reproduction rate $ R_0 $}
Henceforth, the height $ \s $ that separates shaded trees from sun-exposed trees is referred to as `competition'. We used the Method of Characteristics \citep{Olver2014b} to calculate the net reproduction rate at a location $ x $ within a landscape $ \Omega $ as a function of a constant competition $ \s_c $. This mathematical technique is used to solve certain partial-differential equations, as commonly used in transport equations. For example, equation \eqref{eq::dynamics_x} describes the advection (bulk motion) of trees growing at a non-constant speed $ G $ along the size axis (which is either height or diameter). Characteristics allow us to follow individuals throughout their lifespan, \ie they represent the trajectories of individuals in the time-size plane (Fig. S1.1 for an example). The derivation of $ R_0 $ is detailed in Supporting Information Appendix S1. Three underlying assumptions are made for this calculation: (\textit{i}) $ \s $ is considered fixed and known at a value $ \s_c $; (\textit{ii}) only trees larger than $ \s_c $ can reproduce \citep{Strigul2008}; and (\textit{iii}) dispersal is limited to the patch, as stated by equation \eqref{eq::recruitment_x}. Subsequently, the net reproduction rate in a patch $ x $ is consequently:
\begin{equation} \label{eq::R0sol}
	R_0 (x, \s_c) = \exp \left[-\int_0^{\s_c}\frac{\mu(s, \s_c, x)}{G(s, \s_c, x)} \, ds \right] \times \int_{\s_c}^{\infty} \frac{F(s, \s_c)}{G(s, \s_c, x)} \exp \left[-\int_{\s_c}^{s} \frac{\mu(\sigma, \s_c, x)}{G(\sigma, \s_c, x)} \, d\sigma \right] \, ds
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq::R0sol} can be divided into two biological processes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $ \exp\left[-\int_0^{\s_c}\frac{\mu(s, \s_c, x)}{G(s, \s_c, x)} \, ds \right] $ is the proportion of individuals that survive up to the canopy of height $ \s_c $ in plot $ x $,
	\item $ \int_{\s_c}^{\infty} \frac{F(s, \s_c)}{G(s, \s_c, x)} \exp \left[-\int_{\s_c}^{s} \frac{\mu(\sigma, \s_c, x)}{G(\sigma, \s_c, x)} \, d\sigma \right] \, ds $ is the expected production of offspring for an individual that is located in $ x $, during its lifespan. It has two subterms:
	\begin{itemize}[label=\tiny$ \blacksquare $]
		\item $ \frac{F(s, \s_c)}{G(s, \s_c, x)} $ is the number of offspring per unit time for individuals that grow at speed $ G $,
		\item $ \exp \left[-\int_{\s_c}^{s} \frac{\mu(\sigma, \s_c, x)}{G(\sigma, \s_c, x)} \, d\sigma \right] $ is the survivorship of trees of size $ s $. Since $ \mu $ and $ G $ are both positive functions, survivorship is a decreasing function of $ s $.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

From equation \eqref{eq::R0sol}, we understand that the reproduction rate $ R_0 $ can be strengthened by reducing the competition $ \s_c $, by accelerating the average understorey growth $ G(s < \s_c) $ or by diminishing the average mortality rate $ \mu $, or by enhancing the fecundity $ F $. The mathematical proofs for these three mechanisms is found in the Supporting Information Appendix S1. The formula \eqref{eq::R0sol} is a generalisation of the $ R_0 $ that was derived by Purves but was limited to open canopies and stepwise demographic functions. We expressed $ R_0 $ for any individual growth, mortality, or overstorey fecundity functions, and for any canopy height. The same three assertions can be drawn from his study (Supporting Information Appendix S1); however, contrary to Purves, we cannot assert that a faster average overstorey growth rate leads to an increase in $ R_0 $ (due to the complexity of the computations). For the same reason, we cannot calculate the value of $ \s_c $ for a population at equilibrium (\ie when $ R_0 = 1 $), except when the demographic rates are easier to compute, as step functions \citep[Supporting Information Appendix S1 for the proof]{Purves2009}. \\

$ R_0 $ represents the number of individuals produced by a species when rare and that does not affect a community at equilibrium. A species can invade a forest stand with a steady canopy height $ \s_c $ whenever $ R_0 > 1 $. It is, by definition, computed on the linearised problem, which does not reckon with density-dependencies \citep[in the introduction]{Diekmann1990}.

% The net reproductive rate $ R_0 $, which is derived here, is a heuristic tool that relates the individual tree performance under a competition constraint $ \s_c $ to the population performance and is thus the key to addressing our second objective.

\subsection{Data}
We parameterised the demographic functions $ G $ (individual growth) and $ \mu $ (mortality) using data that were obtained from permanent sample plots of the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA, USDA Forest Service), the Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs du Québec, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry of Ontario, Ministry of Natural Resources of New Brunswick, and the forest products company Domtar (Fig. S2.2 for a map of the data). After removing plots that experienced fire or logging, there were \num{7704442} individual measurements (106 species distributed among \num{132240} plots). A record consists of the tree identity, the species, the year at which the individual has been measured, the \textit{\textit{dbh}}, the latitude and longitude of the plot, and the tree's status (alive or dead). Measurements occurred between 1963 and 2010, and frequencies of measurement range from $ \sfrac{1}{1} \text{ yr}^{-1} $ to $ \sfrac{1}{40} \text{ yr}^{-1} $ (with $ 96 \, \% $ of the data between $ \sfrac{1}{3} \text{ yr}^{-1} $ to $ \sfrac{1}{15} \text{ yr}^{-1} $). Both radial growth and mortality are highly variable across the distributions of the individuals (Supporting Information Appendix S2).

Climate data were extracted for each plot using \textsc{anusplin} software \citep{McKenney2011} based upon the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of the permanent plots. Note that for privacy reasons, the FIA offsets plot locations up to $ 1.6 $ km \citep{Gray2012}, which might result in mismatches between the actual climate of the plot and the climate that we assigned. We selected 19 climatic variables (Supporting Information Appendix S2) covering the period 1958-2010 with a spatial resolution of 60 arc seconds ($ \approx 2 \, \text{km}^2 $). To account for climate variability prior to each tree measurement, we averaged each temperature and precipitation variable over a period of five-year period using a moving average (five years is the most frequent interval amongst measurements that are included in the database with $ 38.8 \, \% $ of observations).

We calculated individual tree height and crown area from allometric functions and parameters that are provided in \citet{Purves2007}. We considered the \textit{dbh} of all trees, although most Canadian inventories start with individuals having diameters greater than $ 100 $ mm, while USA inventories start at $ 127 $ mm (5 inches). Some trees have been recorded as dead and then alive; we considered the last living state to be true and ignored `resurrection' events in mortality estimation. By definition, growth and mortality rates require at least two measurements from an individual tree. After calculating the threshold $ \s $ in each plot (see Supporting Information Appendix S2 for the algorithm, and the Data Statement for the R code), trees measured once were discarded. For the growth analysis, we eliminated dead trees and individuals that have either a non-positive \textit{dbh} increment or radial growth greater than 25 mm per year. We parameterised the model for the 14 most abundant species in north-eastern North America (Supporting Information Appendix S2), but we considered all 106 species in the database for the computation of $ \s $. The 14-species dataset that is used in this paper contains \num{69954} plots (75 \% in the USA, and 25 \% in Canada), for a total of \num{3816854} individual measurements. \textit{Abies balsamea} is the most frequently measured species with \num{822265} individual measurements, whereas \textit{Tsuga canadensis} is the least frequently measured with \num{66008} individual measurements. The climatic and geographical ranges of each species can be found in Supporting Information Appendix S2.

\subsection{Parameterisation of demographic rate functions}
We used linear mixed models to parameterise the individual growth ($ G $) and mortality ($ \mu $) rates as a function of climate, canopy status (understorey, if below $ \s $; overstorey, if otherwise), and size (\textit{dbh}). For the fecundity, we used the functions and values from \citet{Purves2008}. We tested linear and quadratic functional forms for the temperature, precipitation, and \textit{dbh} effects, which were all standardised using normal scores. To obtain an optimal climate in the quadratic case, it is necessary to have a negative (positive) slope preceding the squared climate variables for the growth (mortality). Constraining the parameters would force the optimal climate to be contained within the data that were used for parameterisation; therefore, we did not set any constraints. The 19 variables for temperature and precipitation allowed us to try different combinations; however, we preselected certain climatic assemblages based upon the interpretability of the models and the literature (Supporting Information Appendix S3). Each set of species-specific demographic parameters was estimated separately. We based the model comparison on information criteria and $ R^2 $. We ranked the models for each species, and selected the model that on average, fits the best according to information criteria. This model was then imposed on the 14 species. R scripts that are used to format the data and to estimate demographic parameters are available on Github (see Data Availability Statement). 

\subsubsection{Growth}
For the individual growth rate, we assumed a lognormal distribution; thus, $ \log(G) $ is normally distributed. We normalised the logarithm of growth as:
\[
	Y_{G} = \frac{\log(G) - \mathrm{E}[\log(G)]}{\mathrm{sd}[\log(G)]},
\]
and implemented the following generic model:
\begin{equation} \label{eq::glmm_growth}
\begin{split}
	E[Y_G^{i, j}] = & \beta_{j, (x, t)[i]}^{(0)} + \beta_j^{(1)}  \text{canopy status} \, + \\
	& \left(\beta_j^{(2)} + b_j^{(2)} \text{canopy status} \right) T \, +
	\left(\beta_j^{(3)} + b_j^{(3)} \text{canopy status} \right) T^2 \, + \\
	& \left(\beta_j^{(4)} + b_j^{(4)} \text{canopy status} \right) P \, +
	\left(\beta_j^{(5)} + b_j^{(5)} \text{canopy status} \right) P^2 \, + \\
	& \left( \beta_j^{(6)} + b_j^{(6, 1)} T + b_j^{(6, 2)} T^2 +
		b_j^{(6, 3)} P + b_j^{(6, 4)} P^2 \right) \text{dbh} \, + \\
	& \left( \beta_j^{(7)} + b_j^{(7, 1)} T + b_j^{(7, 2)} T^2 +
		b_j^{(7, 3)} P + b_j^{(7, 4)} P^2 \right) \text{dbh}^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $ E[Y_G] $ is the expected value of the normalised logarithm of growth, and $ T $ and $ P $ are the associated explanatory temperature and precipitation, respectively. Canopy status is Boolean (true for the canopy trees, and false otherwise). The indices $ i $ and $ j $ denote the individual and species respectively, and $ (x, t)[i] $ index denotes the group effects (plot $ x $ and year $ t $ of the $ i^{\text{th}} $ individual). Random effects (with a maximum of three effects: spatial, temporal, and plot-specific temporal, respectively) are normally distributed as:
\begin{align*}
	\beta_{j}^{(0, x)} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \bm{\sigma}_{x}^{\text{growth}}) \\
	\beta_{j}^{(0, t)} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \bm{\sigma}_{t}^{\text{growth}}) \\
	\beta_{j}^{(0, xt)} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \bm{\sigma}_{xt}^{\text{growth}})
\end{align*}
Mixed models allow us to group individuals by plots and the years of the second measurement, so we can consider spatial and temporal structures. The plot effect incorporates variation that is driven by local factors, such as soil conditions and disturbance history, while the year (within plot identity) represents temporal variation that is not included in climate. The $ \beta $s are the regression coefficients, and the $ b $s correspond to different variable interactions. Climate interacts with the crowding effect (canopy status) to account for climate response variation to the individual's neighbourhood. Lastly, as bigger trees may be favoured or disadvantaged by climate, \textit{dbh} interacts with climatic variables $ T $ and $ P $. \\

We used the package \textit{lme4} \citep{lme4} to estimate the parameters ($ \beta $s and $ b $s). We tested sub-models of equation \eqref{eq::glmm_growth} to evaluate the effects of competition and climate on $ G $. We used a top-down strategy to select first the random effect structure and, second, the fixed structure. We compared models with the corrected Akaike Information Criterion ($ \text{AIC}_c $), but retained models with a maximum Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) that was lower than $ 20 $ to avoid correlations between variables \citep{Zuur2010}. We chose a VIF of $ 20 $ because of one model for growth that has reasonable maximum VIFs ($ < 6 $) for 11 species, and three species where $ \text{VIF} > 6 $, with 19 as a maximum for \textit{Fagus grandifolia}. We judged that a VIF beyond $ 20 $ implies too much collinearity (F. Guillaume Blanchet, \textit{personal communication}). We denote $ \Delta \text{AIC}_c $ as the difference between a model $ i $ and the model having the smallest $ \text{AIC}_c $:
\[
	\Delta \text{AIC}_c = \text{AIC}_c^{(i)} - \text{AIC}_c^{(\min)}
\]
The best model has the lowest $ \text{AIC}_c $, or equivalently, $ \Delta \text{AIC}_c = 0 $. Calculation of $ \Delta \text{AIC}_c $ was unconstrained with respect to the best model; yet, due to the VIF constraint, the selected model is not the model with $ \Delta \text{AIC}_c = 0 $. We exclusively used models satisfying the constraint $ \text{VIF} < 20 $, from which we computed the common logarithm of the ratio between each model's $ \Delta \text{AIC}_c $ and the minimum $ \Delta \text{AIC}_c $:
\begin{equation} \label{eq::ratio}
	\varphi = \log_{10}\left[ \frac{\Delta \text{AIC}_c}{\min \left( \Delta \text{AIC}_c \right)} \right]
\end{equation}
This ratio represents, within the subset of models satisfying the constraint $ \text{VIF} < 20 $, how many times (to a power of 10) the best model compares to the other models. The common logarithm provides a convenient scale for comparing the models. The best constrained model has $ \varphi = \log_{10}(1) = 0 $.

\subsubsection{Mortality}
For the mortality rate, the response variable $ Y $ is a Boolean describing the transition state between two records (true, if there is a transition from alive to dead; false, if the individual remains alive). The observation of a mortality event depends on the survey interval $ \Delta t $ \citep{Lines2010}. To survive from $ t_0 $ to $ t_1 = t_0 + \Delta t $, an individual $ i $ must survive each year, according to:
\[
	\Prob[\text{survival } i: \, t_0 \to t_1] = \big(1 - \Prob[\text{annual mortality } i]\big)^{\Delta t}
\]
where $ \Prob $ stands for probability. Thus, the probability of observing a mortality event within a span $ \Delta t $ is:
\[
	\Prob[\text{mortality } i: \, t_0 \to t_1] = 1 - \big(1 - \Prob[\text{annual mortality } i]\big)^{\Delta t}
\]

We assumed $ Y $ follows a binomial distribution and used the complementary log-log link function $ g $ to account for the time between two surveys (offset on the intercept, Supporting Information Appendix S3 for a short description of the clog-log function):
\[
	g \big(E[Y_\mu^{i, j}] \big) = \log \left( -\log(1 - E[Y_\mu^{i, j}]) \right)
\]
We worked with the following model:
\begin{equation}\label{eq::glmm_mortality}
\begin{split}
	g \big(E[Y_\mu^{i, j}] \big) = & \beta_{j}^{(0)}  + \beta_j^{(1)}  \text{canopy status} +
		\text{offset}\big(\log(\Delta t_i) \big) \, + \\
	& \left(\beta_j^{(2)} + b_j^{(2)} \text{canopy status} \right) T \, +
	\left(\beta_j^{(3)} + b_j^{(3)} \text{canopy status} \right) T^2 \, + \\
	& \left(\beta_j^{(4)} + b_j^{(4)} \text{canopy status} \right) P \, +
	\left(\beta_j^{(5)} + b_j^{(5)} \text{canopy status} \right) P^2 \, + \\
	& \beta_j^{(6)} \text{dbh} \, + \beta_j^{(7)} \text{dbh}^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the same notations as the growth model are used. We did not include any group effect, given that some plots have only one record for certain years and species, while other plots have recorded no dead trees, a problem that was also faced by \citet{Kunstler2019}. To minimise the uncertainty of death events and to have enough measures per species per time interval, we limited the dataset to measurements with $ \Delta t \in [5, 11] $ ($ 74.9 \% $ of the mortality database). Since the probability of transition from dead to dead is 1, we kept records up to the first death event only (or all measurements, if there were no death events). \\

For mortality, none of the GLMMs from the package \textit{lme4} converged on a solution. We suspect that despite the amount of data, there is little information due to the rarity of tree mortality. We therefore used the package \textit{rstanarm} \citep{rstanarm}, which examines GLMMs in a Bayesian framework, and removed the climate-\textit{dbh} interactions. We used four Markov chains and 3000 iterations for each chain. We retained the default priors of \textit{rstanarm}, which are Gaussian distributions for the regression coefficients $ \beta $s, and exponential distributions for the standard deviations. Parameter values that were used later in the analysis are the medians of the posterior distributions. We used the Widely Applicable Information Criterion, \ie WAIC \citep[and references therein]{Hooten2015} to select the best model. WAIC is based upon the posterior predictive distribution (the distribution to predict new data) and is valid for hierarchical models. However, it assumes that the data are independent given a set of parameters, which could be problematic for our spatial data. As was the case for radial growth, we compared WAICs on a common logarithm scale:
\begin{equation} \label{eq::psi}
	\psi = \log_{10}(\Delta \text{WAIC} + 1)
\end{equation}
The best model has $ \Delta \text{WAIC} = 0 $, which implies $ \psi $ is also null for the best model. Although there are $ R^2 $ estimates for Bayesian regression models, they cannot be compared: the explained variance only can be interpreted in the context of a single model \citep{Gelman2018}. Hence, we based our choice exclusively on WAIC. We checked the convergence of the selected model for all parameters and species with the Gelman-Rubin statistic \citep[R-hat diagnostic]{Gelman1992}. Typically, a chain with an R-hat greater than 1.05 is considered non-convergent; at convergence, R-hat should be 1.

\subsubsection{Fecundity}
The forest inventory data have few records of trees with a \textit{dbh} less than 10 cm; thus, we could not parameterise the fecundity function $ F(s, \s) $. Instead, we used the fecundity function that was defined by \citet{Purves2008} and parameterised as:
\begin{align} \label{eq::fecundity_fct}
	F_{\text{Purves}}(s, \s) = \F \times \A(s, \s) && \F = 0.0071
\end{align}
where $ \F $ is the number of seeds produced per sun-exposed tree crown area per unit time (Table \ref{tab::notations}). In this particular case, we defined a new quantity $ \rho_0 $ as the net reproduction rate $ R_0 $ with the reproduction function $ F_{\text{Purves}} $. The notation $ R_0 $ is strictly reserved to the general case, where the fecundity function is not restricted to the function of Purves.

By definition, $ \rho_0 $ corresponds to the net reproduction rate when the fecundity function is independent of climate (\ie spatially constant). Once $ \rho_0 $ is calculated across the landscape $ \Omega $ (using equation \eqref{eq::rho0} defined below), we can estimate a convenient normalised quantity as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq::rho0_scaled}
	\tilde \rho_0(x, \s) = \frac{\rho_0(x, \s) - \min_{x \in \Omega} \big(\rho_0(x, \s) \big)}{\max_{x \in \Omega} \big(\rho_0(x, \s) \big) - \min_{x \in \Omega} \big(\rho_0(x, \s) \big)}
\end{equation}
This cancels the value of $ \F $, which was a difficult parameter to estimate in \citet{Purves2008}, and bounds $ \tilde \rho_0 $ between $ 0 $ and $ 1 $.

\subsection{Occurrence probability}
We evaluated the correlation for each species between $ \tilde \rho_0 $ and the probability of occurrence $ P_{occ} $, which is derived from a random forest model \citep[R package]{randomForest}. This is a way of transforming discrete presence and absence data into probabilities, which are continuous data. It has been shown that random forests perform well in terms of predicting tree species distributions \citep{Prasad2006}. Using a continuous probability rather than presence--absence data can be useful in the case where climatic conditions are favourable but species are absent because of stochasticity and, alternatively, where species are present but should not occur.

We trained the algorithm with coordinates from the sample plot dataset, where at least one species was recorded. We assigned 0 to each coordinates--species couple where there were no records for that species in $ (x, y) $ after 1996, and 1 otherwise. We set the random forest with $ 2000 $ trees, and $ 12 $ predictors (over 19) to be selected at each tree node. More trees add precision and bound the generalisation error (\ie the true error of the population as opposed to the training error only), without overfitting the data \citep{Prasad2006}. The explanatory variables set contained 19 bioclimatic variables (Supporting Information Appendix S2 for the variables and S6 for the equation). The performance of the random forest was evaluated with the $ R^2 $ from \citet{Tjur2009}, and later denoted as $ R_{\text{Tjur}}^2 $.

\subsection{Species distribution maps}
We downloaded an expert range map $ \Omega_j $ \citep{Prasad2003, Little1971} for each species $ j $, and calculated $ \tilde \rho_0 $ for each location within $ \Omega_j $ for a climate averaged over five years (from 2006 to 2010) and a canopy height $ \s $ of either $ 0 $ m (no competition) or $ 10 $ m (the average for the distribution of $ \s $ across the database is $ 9.6 $ m). Hereafter, we drop the index $ j $ and only use $ \Omega $, although the expert range maps are species-specific.

We investigated within the box that bounds our data (orange rectangle in Fig. S2.2), how $ \tilde \rho_0 $ relates to the orthodromic distance from the closest edge of the distribution that was defined by \citet{Little1971}, and mapped the variations in $ \tilde \rho_0 $. In order to avoid spatial extrapolations of the demographic rates, we decided to limit our study to the region of parameterisation (for instance, \textit{Betula papyrifera} extends to Alaska). To evaluate in which direction $ \tilde \rho_0 $ increases, we computed its vector field $ \nabla \tilde \rho_0 $ on $ \Omega $ using the algorithm of \citet{Ritter1987}. The vector field $ \nabla \tilde \rho_0 $ provides at any location $ x \in \Omega $ the gradient of $ \tilde \rho_0 $, which is its local direction of increase. We then separated $ \Omega $ into two regions---north and south with respect to the centroid of $ \Omega $---and we averaged the gradients for each region. If $ \tilde \rho_0 $ decreases towards range limits, then both gradients should point toward the centre of the distribution. That is to say, the gradient of the northern region should point southward, and the gradient of the southern region should point northward. \\

We must integrate upwards to infinity to compute $ \tilde \rho_0 $ (see equations \eqref{eq::rho0} and \eqref{eq::rho0_scaled}), but we found numerically that the integral beyond a height of 45 metres is negligible (because $ \lim_{\text{s} \to \infty} G(s) = 0 $ and $ \mu > 0 $). To be closer to actual maximum \textit{dbh} and height of trees for a given location $ x \in \Omega $ (rather than arbitrarily setting a maximum height of 45 m), we determined the upper boundary $ s_{\infty}^{x} $ of the integral of $ \tilde \rho_0 $ in three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Obtain species-specific maximal age ($ \text{age}_{\max} $) and maximal \textit{dbh} ($ \text{dbh}_{\max} $) from \citet{Burns1990, Burns1990a}. The data are in Supporting Information Appendix S2
	\item Compute what \textit{dbh} a tree would have at the location $ x $ with the associated climate $ \text{clim}_x $ if it were spending its entire life in the overstorey up to the maximal age (using the solver ODE45 from Matlab):
	\[
		s_{\max}^{x} = \int_0^{\text{age}_{\max}} G^{\text{(overstorey)}}\big(s(t), \text{clim}_x \big) \, dt
	\]
	\item Set the local `infinite \textit{dbh}':
	\begin{equation} \label{eq::s_inf}
		s_{\infty}^{x} = \min(\text{dbh}_{\max}, \text{s}_{\max}^{x})
	\end{equation}
	and replace $ \infty $ in equation \eqref{eq::R0sol} by $ s_{\infty}^{x} $. If $ s_{\infty} < \s_c $, which happens when trees cannot reach the canopy before reaching their maximum ages, we set $ R_0 $ to 0.
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, equation \eqref{eq::rho0} combines the equations \eqref{eq::R0sol}, \eqref{eq::fecundity_fct}, and \eqref{eq::s_inf} to measure species performance:
\begin{equation} \label{eq::rho0}
	\rho_0(x, \s_c) = \exp \left[-\int_0^{\s_c}\frac{\mu(s, \s_c, x)}{G(s, \s_c, x)} \, ds \right] \times \int_{\s_c}^{s_{\infty}^{x}} \frac{\F \A(s, \s_c)}{G(s, \s_c, x)} \exp \left[-\int_{\s_c}^{s} \frac{\mu(\sigma, \s_c, x)}{G(\sigma, \s_c, x)} \, d\sigma \right] \, ds
\end{equation}
from which we can derive $ \tilde \rho_0 $ (using equation \eqref{eq::rho0_scaled}). Equation \eqref{eq::rho0} accounts for spatial differences in the maximum \textit{dbh} that are not included in the radial growth model. Its major difference with \eqref{eq::R0sol} is the upper boundary of the expected production of offsprings (the second integral), which makes equation \eqref{eq::rho0} specific to this paper, while equation \eqref{eq::R0sol} is a generalisation of \citet{Purves2009}.

\subsection{Roadmap}
We first parameterised individual growth and mortality as functions of climate and competition for 14 northern North American trees. Competition refers to the canopy status (either in the understorey or overstorey), and was calculated using allometric functions and equation \eqref{eq::ppa_x}. We then computed the population growth rates $ \tilde \rho_0 $ within each species' range $ \Gamma $ to test the Abundant-Centre Hypothesis, together with correlations between $ \tilde \rho_0 $ and species performance.
